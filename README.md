# growth-decay-calci
In the project, we developed exponential and logarithmic functions from a pure-mathematical  point of view. We developed a C program which allows the user to select what type of  question they will be evaluating based on the given information. It also automatically checks  whether the given information is related to growth or decay and then returns the required  quantity.
