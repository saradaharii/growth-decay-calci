# growth-decay-calci
In the project, we developed exponential and logarithmic functions from a pure-mathematical  point of view. We developed a C program which allows the user to select what type of  question they will be evaluating based on the given information. It also automatically checks  whether the given information is related to growth or decay and then returns the required  quantity.
We have provided with 3 options:
1. To calculate the amount of substance present after time T when the initial details are 
known.
2. To calculate the time T at which the amount of substance is given.
3. To calculate the initial amount of the substance when 2 sets of parameters are given.
The program automatically decides whether the question has to follow natural Decay or 
natural Growth.
